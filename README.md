# Dart: Unhandled Exceptions and Missing Nested JSON Key
This example demonstrates a common issue in Dart applications: inadequate error handling when dealing with asynchronous operations and nested JSON data. The original code uses a generic `catch` block, masking the underlying error. Additionally, it doesn't gracefully handle cases where a key is missing from the nested JSON structure.

## Problem:
* Generic exception handling prevents detailed error reporting, hindering debugging.
* Missing key in the nested JSON ('nested')['data'] causes a runtime error if the key is absent. 

## Solution:
The solution introduces specific error handling to identify network issues, JSON decoding errors, and missing keys in nested structures.  It prints informative error messages to aid debugging, preventing unexpected application crashes.
